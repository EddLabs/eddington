Sir Arthur Eddington (28 December 1882 â€“ 22 November 1944) was an English astronomer,
physicist, and mathematician. His paper "The Internal Constitution of the Stars" (1920)
predicted the discovery of nuclear fusion inside stars.

During the solar eclipse of 1919 he conducted the first experiment to demonstrate
Einstein's theory of general relativity. Even though the reliability of the experiment
is questionable, it was ground breaking in the sense that an English physicist agreed
to even consider a theory by a German physicist, during World War I, a theory so
radical, which contradicts another great English physicist, Sir Isaac Newton.

Eddington died from cancer at the age of 61. He had no wife and no children.

For his dedication to the scientific method, one which exceeds any
political believes, we decided to honour his name by naming our data fitting platform
after him.
