Sir Arthur Eddington (28 December 1882 â€“ 22 November 1944) was an English astronomer,
physicist, and mathematician. His paper "The Internal Constitution of the Stars" (1920)
predicted the discovery of nuclear fusion inside stars.

During the solar eclipse of 1919 he conducted the first experiment to demonstrate
Einstein's theory of general relativity. Even though the reliability of the experiment
is questionable, it was ground breaking. It was the first time that an English physicist
agreed to even consider a theory that was published by a German physicist during World
War I -- a theory so radical, which contradicts another great English physicist, Sir
Isaac Newton.

It was Eddington's dedication to the real, free scientific mind, one which isn't bound
by geographical or political borders, that helped Einstein's theory make its first
steps toward global consensus. Today, Einstein's theory of general relativity has been
proven hundreds of times, based on thousands of observations, all which started by
Eddington's first attempt.

Eddington died from cancer at the age of 61. He had no wife and no children.

For his dedication to the scientific method, and his dedicated quest towards the world's
hidden truths, we decided to honour his name by naming our data fitting platform
after him.
