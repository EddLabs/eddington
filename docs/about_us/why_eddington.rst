Why Should I Use Eddington?
===========================

* It's high-level so you don't need to write many lines of code in order to get a decent fit.
* It's open-source and free to use.
* It's based on other state-of-the-art scientific python libraries such as *numpy*, *scipy* and *matplotlib*.
* It supports a vast list of out-of-the-box fitting functions.
* It can read and write data from many of the standard data files formats such as CSV, Json and Excel.
* It's fast and accurate.
* You can use Eddington in your most convenient way: as a python library, as a CLI or as a GUI.
* It's expendable: You can build upon it to write data manipulation functions, new fitting functions and etc.

Is There A Reason I Won't Want to Use Eddington?
------------------------------------------------

You may want to consider other platforms if:

* You prefer Matlab over Python. In that case, Eddington won't help you.
* You want to fit your data in an unorthodox way.
* You want to "put your hands in the mud" and use a lower-level fitting library.
* You don't like English scientists.
